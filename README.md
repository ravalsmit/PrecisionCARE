The task involves applying three feature selection methods on a breast cancer dataset and subsequently training and evaluating machine learning models to achieve an accuracy above 90%.

The feature selection methods include:
- Filter Method (SelectKBest with ANOVA)
- Wrapper Method (Recursive Feature Elimination with RandomForestClassifier)
- Embedded Method (Feature Importance from RandomForestClassifier)

Three machine learning models are employed:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
